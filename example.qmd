## Demo

This is a webr-enabled code cell in a Quarto HTML document.

```webr
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)
```

```webr
1 + 1 
```

## A plot

Try this out, you can even plot!

```webr
iris$Sepal.Length |> 
  plot()
```

## Static code

However, you can still use the static code chunks -- no problem there.

```{r}
names(iris)
```
